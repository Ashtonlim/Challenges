## Introduction
The scripts provided below allows easy extraction of flags from the given files and placed them in a seperate folder. Firstly, GetAllFlags.py will utiltize IDA Educational or IDA Pro with the use of AutomateGetAssignment2Flag_IDA.py script. Once AutomateGetAssignment2Flag_IDA.py script is executed inside IDA, flags will be extracted. Extracted flags will be stored in a folder called "Flags/<file's name>". Alternatively, AutomateGetAssignment2Flag_IDA.py script can be directly run in IDA to extract flags for individual files.


## Requirement
1. Python v3.0 or greater
2. IDA Educational or IDA Pro


## Files
1. GetAllFlags.py - Extraction of all flags from files in a folder using AutomateGetAssignment2Flag_IDA.py with IDA.
2. AutomateGetAssignment2Flag_IDA.py - Script to be loaded into IDA to extract the flag


## Notice
Before utilizing GetAllFlags.py, make sure python is set in the environment variable. Alternatively, you can use the command "py" instead of "python" in the terminal.


## Usage
GetAllFlags.py is a Python script used to extract flags from all files in a folder. There are two ways to use GetAllFlags.py: Place the two scripts (GetAllFlags.py and AutomateGetAssignment2Flag_IDA.py) in the same folder as the files to extract flag from or the two scripts and the files can be in a different folder location.


When the files to extract flags from and script from in different location, input the following format into a terminal:

Format: python GetAllFlags.py <Path to IDA executable> <Path to folder with files to extract>

Example: python GetAllFlags.py "C:\Program Files\IDA Educational 7.4\ida64.exe" "C:\Users\user\Documents"


When the files and the two scripts are in the same folder, input the following format into a terminal:

Format: python GetAllFlags.py <Path to IDA executable>

Example: python GetAllFlags.py "C:\Program Files\IDA Educational 7.4\ida64.exe"


To see the usage of GetAllFlags.py, input one of the following command into a terminal:

1. python GetAllFlags.py -h
2. python GetAllFlags.py -help


Alternatively, we can use AutomateGetAssignment2Flag_IDA.py to extract flags directly from IDA in the GUI format. AutomateGetAssignment2Flag_IDA.py is another Python script that will be executed directly by IDA Educational or IDA Pro. To use it directly inside IDA, follow the following steps:

1. Open IDA Educational or IDA Pro with any of the 22 given files.
2. Go to File > Script File...
3. Navigate to AutomateGetAssignment2Flag_IDA.py and run it.
4. Flags will be store in the folder, "Flags/<file's name>".
